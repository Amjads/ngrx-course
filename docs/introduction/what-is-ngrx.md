# What is NgRx?

NgRx is a reactive library for Angular (not AngularJS) that is composed of several modules for managing application state.
NgRx is inspired by the Redux library, which is a popular library for managing state in a React application.

## What is Reactive?

[Reative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming), defined by Wikipedia:

> In computing, reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change.

A couple of things should stick out to us as Angular developers:

1. Data streams
2. Popagation of change

## Modules

NgRx is composed of several modules:

* @ngrx/store
* @ngrx/effects
* @ngrx/router-store
* @ngrx/store-devtools
* @ngrx/entity
* @ngrx/schematics
