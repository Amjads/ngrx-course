# Story

We've been given a story to add a new feature to our application to allow the user to search for a ski resort.

We'll need to:

1. Create the necessary actions.
2. Create a reducer function to mutate the state.
3. Create an effect to perform the asynchronous HTTP request.
4. Handle any errors that occur if the HTTP requests fail or the API returns a 500 status code.
